Find Defective Coin Program takes the input as the size of array(No of the coins to be tested) and then takes the weigh of the coins as input.

The program uses Divide and conquer Approach, the array is divided into two halves and the one weighing less is again divides into two halves and weighed recursively.

This reduces the weighing to log(n) times

There are a few “constant” checks outside the halving:

If n is odd, sometimes you need 1 extra weighing to test the leftover coin.


If all coins are equal, you might need 1 more check to confirm “no defective coin.”

Therefore the time complexity comes as log(n)(base 2) + constant(C) 

How to Use:
Input the number of coins when prompted.
Enter the weight of each coin.
The program will output the index (0-based) of the defective lighter coin if found.
If all coins are of equal weight, it reports no defective coin.
