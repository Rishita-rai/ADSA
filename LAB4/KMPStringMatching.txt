KNUTH–MORRIS–PRATT (KMP) STRING MATCHING ALGORITHM

INTRODUCTION

This program implements the Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) string matching algorithm using the C programming language.

The KMP algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a given text by avoiding unnecessary comparisons using a preprocessing step called the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array.

OBJECTIVES

• To implement the KMP string matching algorithm
• To understand the concept of prefix function (LPS array)
• To efficiently search a pattern in a text
• To reduce redundant character comparisons

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

Step 1: LPS Array Construction
• Compute the Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array for the pattern
• LPS[i] stores the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix for pattern[0..i]

Step 2: Pattern Matching
• Compare characters of text and pattern
• On match, move both indices forward
• On mismatch, use LPS array to shift the pattern without rechecking characters

Step 3: Pattern Found
• When pattern index reaches its length, a match is found
• Continue searching for next possible match

PROGRAM STRUCTURE

Function Name Description

computeLPSArray() Builds the LPS array
KMPSearch() Searches pattern in text
main() Takes input and runs program

INPUT SPECIFICATION

• Input consists of two strings
• First string is the text
• Second string is the pattern
• Strings should not contain spaces
• Maximum length of each string is 100

Example Input:
ABABDABACDABABCABAB
ABABCABAB

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

• Prints starting index of each pattern occurrence in the text

Example Output:
Pattern found at index 10

COMPILATION AND EXECUTION

Compilation:
gcc kmp.c -o kmp

Execution:
./kmp

TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY

Time Complexity : O(n + m)
Space Complexity : O(m)

Where:
n = length of text
m = length of pattern

LIMITATIONS

• Strings with spaces are not supported
• Maximum string length is fixed using macro
• Input is case-sensitive

APPLICATIONS

• Text searching and pattern matching
• DNA and protein sequence analysis
• Search engines
• Intrusion detection systems
