LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE (LCS) USING DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING IN C

INTRODUCTION

This program implements the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem using Dynamic Programming in the C programming language.

Given two strings, the program:
• Computes the length of the LCS
• Prints one valid LCS
• Generates and prints all common subsequences (may include duplicates)

The LCS problem is widely used in string matching, bioinformatics, and version control systems.

OBJECTIVES

• Implement LCS using dynamic programming
• Construct DP table for optimal substructure
• Print the LCS sequence
• Generate all common subsequences
• Demonstrate backtracking in DP

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

Step 1: DP Table Construction
• Create a 2D table dp[m+1][n+1]
• Initialize first row and column to zero

Step 2: Table Filling
• If characters match, add 1 to diagonal value
• If characters do not match, take maximum of left and top cell

Step 3: LCS Reconstruction
• Start from dp[m][n]
• Move diagonally for matches
• Move in direction of maximum value otherwise

Step 4: Generate All Common Subsequences
• Recursively explore all matching and skipping paths
• Print all subsequences (duplicates possible)

TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY

LCS Computation:
Time Complexity : O(m × n)
Space Complexity : O(m × n)

All Subsequences Generation:
Time Complexity : Exponential
Space Complexity : O(n) (recursion stack)

LIMITATIONS

• Duplicate subsequences may be printed
• Strings without spaces only
• Maximum length limited by constant MAX

APPLICATIONS

• DNA sequence analysis
• File comparison tools
• Version control systems
• Pattern matching problems
