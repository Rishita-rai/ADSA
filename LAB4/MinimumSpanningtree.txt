MINIMUM SPANNING TREE USING PRIM’S AND KRUSKAL’S ALGORITHMS

INTRODUCTION

This program implements Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) construction using two greedy algorithms:

Prim’s Algorithm

Kruskal’s Algorithm

The program reads a weighted, undirected graph in SIF (Simple Interaction Format) and computes the MST using both algorithms, displaying the selected edges and the total cost.

OBJECTIVES

• To represent a graph using adjacency matrix
• To read graph input in SIF format
• To construct MST using Prim’s algorithm
• To construct MST using Kruskal’s algorithm
• To compare both greedy approaches

INPUT FORMAT (SIF)

The graph is entered using SIF format:

Vertices are named using uppercase letters: A, B, C, …

Each edge is entered as:
u v w
where
u = source vertex
v = destination vertex
w = edge weight

Input terminates with:
-1 -1 -1

Example Input:
Enter number of vertices: 4

A B 10
A C 6
A D 5
B D 15
C D 4
-1 -1 -1

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

PRIM’S ALGORITHM:
• Start from an arbitrary vertex
• Select the minimum weight edge connecting MST to a new vertex
• Repeat until all vertices are included

KRUSKAL’S ALGORITHM:
• Sort all edges by increasing weight
• Select the smallest edge that does not form a cycle
• Use Union-Find to detect cycles
• Repeat until MST is complete
