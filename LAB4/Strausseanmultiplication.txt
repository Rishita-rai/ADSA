STRASSEN’S MATRIX MULTIPLICATION USING DIVIDE AND CONQUER

INTRODUCTION

This program implements Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication Algorithm using the C programming language.

Strassen’s algorithm is an optimized divide-and-conquer technique for matrix multiplication that reduces the number of multiplications compared to the conventional method, thereby improving performance for large matrices.

OBJECTIVES

• To implement matrix multiplication using Strassen’s algorithm
• To understand divide-and-conquer strategy
• To reduce the number of scalar multiplications
• To perform multiplication of square matrices efficiently

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

Step 1: Base Case
• If matrix size is 1×1, multiply the single elements

Step 2: Divide
• Divide both matrices A and B into four submatrices
A11, A12, A21, A22
B11, B12, B21, B22

Step 3: Conquer
• Compute the following seven products recursively:

M1 = (A11 + A22) × (B11 + B22)
M2 = (A21 + A22) × B11
M3 = A11 × (B12 − B22)
M4 = A22 × (B21 − B11)
M5 = (A11 + A12) × B22
M6 = (A21 − A11) × (B11 + B12)
M7 = (A12 − A22) × (B21 + B22)

Step 4: Combine
• Compute result submatrices:

C11 = M1 + M4 − M5 + M7
C12 = M3 + M5
C21 = M2 + M4
C22 = M1 − M2 + M3 + M6

• Combine C11, C12, C21, C22 into result matrix C
