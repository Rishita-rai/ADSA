SIMPLEX METHOD FOR LINEAR PROGRAMMING (MAXIMIZATION)

INTRODUCTION

This program implements the Simplex Method to solve a Linear Programming Problem (LPP) for maximization using the C programming language.

The Simplex algorithm is an iterative procedure used to find the optimal solution of a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.

OBJECTIVES

• To implement the Simplex method step-by-step
• To solve maximization problems in linear programming
• To understand pivot selection and tableau updates
• To display intermediate simplex tables
• To find the optimal value of the objective function

PROBLEM FORMULATION

The program solves problems of the form:

Maximize
Z = c1x1 + c2x2 + ... + cnxn

Subject to:
a11x1 + a12x2 + ... + a1nxn ≤ b1
a21x1 + a22x2 + ... + a2nxn ≤ b2
...
am1x1 + am2x2 + ... + amnxn ≤ bm

x1, x2, ..., xn ≥ 0

Slack variables are added to convert inequalities into equations.

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

Step 1: Initialization
• Construct the initial simplex tableau
• Add slack variables
• Convert objective function into standard form

Step 2: Entering Variable Selection
• Choose the most negative coefficient in the objective row

Step 3: Leaving Variable Selection
• Apply the minimum ratio test
• Select pivot row

Step 4: Pivot Operation
• Divide pivot row by pivot element
• Make all other elements in pivot column zero

Step 5: Optimality Check
• If no negative coefficient remains, optimal solution is reached
