ELLIPSOID METHOD FOR LINEAR FEASIBILITY PROBLEM

INTRODUCTION

This program implements the Ellipsoid Method, a fundamental algorithm in convex optimization, to find a feasible solution to a system of linear inequalities of the form:

A x ≤ b

The algorithm iteratively updates an ellipsoid that contains the feasible region and shrinks it until a feasible point is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

OBJECTIVES

• To implement the Ellipsoid Method for linear feasibility
• To understand ellipsoid center and shape matrix updates
• To detect violated constraints
• To iteratively refine the search region
• To find a feasible solution (if one exists)

PROBLEM FORMULATION

Given:

Matrix A ∈ R^(m×n)

Vector b ∈ R^m

Find a vector x ∈ R^n such that:

A x ≤ b

The algorithm starts with an initial ellipsoid that is guaranteed (or assumed) to contain the feasible region.

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

Step 1: Initialization
• Choose an initial center x
• Choose initial radius R
• Initialize ellipsoid shape matrix P = R² I

Step 2: Constraint Evaluation
• Compute A x
• Check if any constraint is violated

Step 3: Feasibility Check
• If no constraint is violated, x is feasible

Step 4: Ellipsoid Update
• Select a violated constraint aᵢ
• Update center using:
x ← x − (1/(n+1)) · (P aᵢ) / √(aᵢᵀ P aᵢ)

• Update shape matrix using:
P ← (n²/(n² − 1)) · [P − (2/(n+1)) · (P aᵢ aᵢᵀ P) / (aᵢᵀ P aᵢ)]

Step 5: Iteration
• Repeat until feasible solution is found or iteration limit is reached
