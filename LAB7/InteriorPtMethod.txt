INTERIOR POINT METHOD USING LOG BARRIER FUNCTION

INTRODUCTION

This program implements a basic Interior Point Method for solving a linear programming problem using a logarithmic barrier function.

The method converts the constrained optimization problem into a sequence of unconstrained problems by adding a barrier term that penalizes violation of non-negativity constraints and gradually reduces the barrier parameter.

OBJECTIVES

• To implement the Interior Point Method for linear optimization
• To use logarithmic barrier functions for inequality constraints
• To apply gradient descent for minimizing the barrier objective
• To iteratively reduce the barrier parameter
• To approximate the optimal solution

PROBLEM FORMULATION

The program solves the following optimization problem:

Minimize
f(x) = cᵀx

Subject to:
A x = b
x > 0

The barrier formulation becomes:

f_μ(x) = cᵀx − μ Σ log(xᵢ)

where μ > 0 is the barrier parameter.

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

Step 1: Initialization
• Choose an initial strictly feasible point x > 0
• Set initial barrier parameter μ

Step 2: Barrier Objective Minimization
• Compute gradient of the barrier objective
• Perform gradient descent updates
• Maintain positivity of x

Step 3: Equality Constraint Handling
• Project solution back to satisfy A x = b
• Repeat until convergence

Step 4: Barrier Reduction
• Reduce μ by a constant factor
• Repeat inner minimization

Step 5: Termination
• When μ becomes sufficiently small, x approximates the optimal solution
