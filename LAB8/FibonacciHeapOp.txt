FIBONACCI HEAP IMPLEMENTATION IN C

INTRODUCTION

This program implements a Fibonacci Heap, an advanced priority queue data structure that supports several operations with amortized constant or logarithmic time complexity.

Fibonacci heaps are especially useful in graph algorithms such as Dijkstra’s and Prim’s, where frequent decrease-key operations are required.

OBJECTIVES

• To implement a Fibonacci Heap using linked structures
• To support insertion, deletion, and key-decrease operations
• To understand amortized analysis of heap operations
• To demonstrate cascading cuts and consolidation
• To provide a menu-driven interface for heap operations

DATA STRUCTURES USED

• Circular doubly linked lists (for root list and child lists)
• Tree nodes with parent–child relationships
• Marked nodes for cascading cut mechanism

Each heap node stores:

key value

degree (number of children)

mark flag

pointers to parent, child, left, and right siblings

OPERATIONS SUPPORTED

INSERT
• Inserts a new key into the heap
• Time Complexity: O(1) amortized

FIND MIN
• Returns the minimum key
• Time Complexity: O(1)

EXTRACT MIN
• Removes and returns the minimum key
• Consolidates trees of equal degree
• Time Complexity: O(log n) amortized

DECREASE KEY
• Decreases the key value of a node
• Performs cut and cascading cut if heap property is violated
• Time Complexity: O(1) amortized

DELETE
• Deletes a node by decreasing its key to −∞ and extracting min
• Time Complexity: O(log n) amortized

DISPLAY
• Displays all keys in the root list

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

INSERT:
• Add new node to the root list
• Update min pointer if required

EXTRACT MIN:
• Remove minimum node
• Move its children to root list
• Perform consolidation

DECREASE KEY:
• Update key value
• Cut node if heap property is violated
• Perform cascading cuts

DELETE:
• Decrease key to INT_MIN
• Extract minimum
