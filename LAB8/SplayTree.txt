SPLAY TREE IMPLEMENTATION IN C

INTRODUCTION

This program implements a Splay Tree, which is a self-adjusting binary search tree.
In a splay tree, whenever a node is accessed (inserted, searched, or deleted), it is splayed to the root using tree rotations.

This property ensures that frequently accessed elements stay near the root, providing amortized efficient performance.

OBJECTIVES

• To implement a self-adjusting binary search tree
• To understand splaying operations (Zig, Zig-Zig, Zig-Zag)
• To support insertion, search, and deletion
• To analyze amortized performance of splay trees
• To provide a menu-driven implementation

DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION

Each node of the splay tree contains:

Key value

Pointer to left child

Pointer to right child

The tree maintains the Binary Search Tree (BST) property.

SPLAY OPERATIONS

ZIG (Single Rotation):
• Applied when the accessed node is a child of the root

ZIG-ZIG (Double Rotation – Same Direction):
• Left-Left or Right-Right case

ZIG-ZAG (Double Rotation – Opposite Direction):
• Left-Right or Right-Left case

These rotations move the accessed node to the root.

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

INSERT:
• Insert key as in BST
• Splay the inserted node to the root

SEARCH:
• Search for key
• Splay the accessed node to the root (even if unsuccessful)

DELETE:
• Splay the key to the root
• Remove the root
• Join left and right subtrees

INORDER TRAVERSAL:
• Prints keys in sorted order

PROGRAM STRUCTURE

Function Name Description

createNode() Creates a new tree node
leftRotate() Performs left rotation
rightRotate() Performs right rotation
splay() Brings a node to root
insert() Inserts a key
search() Searches and splays a key
delete() Deletes a key
inorder() Inorder traversal
main() Menu-driven execution

INPUT SPECIFICATION

• User selects operations from menu
• Keys are integer values

Menu Options:

Insert

Search

Delete

Inorder Traversal

Exit

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

• Displays status of search and delete operations
• Displays inorder traversal
• Displays confirmation messages

Example Output:
Found and splayed to root.
Inorder: 10 20 30 40

TIME COMPLEXITY (AMORTIZED)

Search : O(log n)
Insert : O(log n)
Delete : O(log n)

Worst Case (single operation): O(n)
Amortized over sequence: O(log n)

LIMITATIONS

• Does not store parent pointers
• Worst-case time for a single operation is linear
• Recursive implementation may cause deep recursion

APPLICATIONS

• Cache and memory management
• Self-adjusting data structures
• Symbol tables
• Adaptive data access systems
