KNUTH–MORRIS–PRATT (KMP) STRING MATCHING ALGORITHM

INTRODUCTION

This program implements the Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) string matching algorithm using the C programming language.

KMP is an efficient pattern searching algorithm that avoids unnecessary re-comparisons by preprocessing the pattern using the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array.

OBJECTIVES

• To implement the KMP string matching algorithm
• To understand prefix-suffix preprocessing (LPS array)
• To efficiently search a pattern within a text
• To reduce redundant character comparisons

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

Step 1: LPS Array Construction
• Compute the Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array for the pattern
• LPS[i] represents the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix of pattern[0..i]

Step 2: Pattern Searching
• Compare characters of text and pattern
• On mismatch, use LPS values to skip unnecessary comparisons
• Continue until the entire text is scanned

Step 3: Result Reporting
• Print all starting indices where the pattern occurs
• Print message if pattern is not found

PROGRAM STRUCTURE

Function Name Description

buildLPS() Builds the LPS array
KMPsearch() Searches pattern in text
main() Accepts input and runs program

INPUT SPECIFICATION

• Input consists of:

A text string (can contain spaces)

A pattern string

• Input is taken using fgets()

Example Input:
Text:
ABABDABACDABABCABAB

Pattern:
ABABCABAB

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

• Displays starting index/indices of the pattern in the text
• Displays message if pattern is not found

Example Output:
Pattern found at index 10

COMPILATION AND EXECUTION

Compilation:
gcc kmp.c -o kmp

Execution:
./kmp

TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY

Time Complexity : O(n + m)
Space Complexity : O(m)

Where:
n = length of text
m = length of pattern

LIMITATIONS

• Case-sensitive matching
• Pattern length must be > 0
• Uses fixed-size input buffers

APPLICATIONS

• Text editors and search tools
• Search engines
• DNA and protein sequence analysis
• Pattern matching in strings
